Refuge lands are managed to provide wintering habitat for waterfowl and to protect endangered species such as piping plover, sea turtles, and sea beach amaranth. 



Habitat types common to most barrier islands are found on the refuge.  Moving westward from the Atlantic Ocean to Currituck Sound, these habitats include sandy beaches, grassy dunes, interdunal wetlands (flats), maritime forests and shrub thickets.  Currituck Sound's shoreline is comprised of brackish water marshes and occasionally, mud flats that have been exposed by wind tides.  A few forested islands also exist on the refuge.  Monkey Island, a noted bird rookery, provides nesting habitat to several species of wading birds. Vegetation within these diverse habitat types include various types of beach grasses, live oak, loblolly pine, wax myrtle, cattails, sedges and rushes, black needlerush and giant cordgrass.



Various types of wading birds, shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors, mammals (including feral horses), reptiles, and amphibians common to the eastern United States, are found on the refuge.  The endangered piping plover and loggerhead sea turtle sometimes nest on refuge beaches and dunes.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>Currituck NWR consists of six seperate units all located between Corolla, NC and the NC/VA stateline.

Situated along the Pee Dee River, Pee Dee NWR contains 8,443 acres in Anson and Richmond Counties, NC.  The refuge was established to provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl.



Cooperative farming in field impoundments, water level management, and the bottomland hardwood forest along Brown Creek provide excellent habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife.  Wintering waterfowl numbers fluctuate greatly, but can exceed 10,000 birds yearly.  The refuge also supports a small population of wintering Southern James Bay Canada geese.

Pee Dee Refuge is located a few hundred yards from the once famous "Lockhart Gaddy Wild Goose Refuge".  In the 1950's, Gaddy's pond wintered more than 10,000 Canada geese a year.  Pee Dee National Wildlife Refuge was established in October 1963 to provide additional habitat for these geese and other waterfowl.  Local numbers of wintering migratory geese have dwindled in recent years, but the refuge remains an important wintering area for the remaining geese and thousands of ducks.



But Pee Dee has more than just waterfowl. The refuge also supports an abundance of nesting neotropical migratory birds, bobwhite quail, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer.  The diversity of habitat and management provides for more than 168 bird species, 49 reptiles and amphibians, 28 mammals, and 20 fish species.  Refuge lands include the following habitat types: bottomland hardwood forest (3,000 acres), upland pine forest (1,500 acres), mixed pine/hardwood forest (2,000 acres), crop lands (1,000 acres), old fields, native warm season grass fields, and openings (1,000 acres).</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>From Charlotte, NC:  Take Hwy. 74 East to Wadesboro.

Pocosin Lakes NWR was established in 1990 when the Conservation Fund in conjunction with the Richard King Mellon Foundation donated over 93,000 acres to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.  The adjacent 12,000 acre Pungo NWR, established in 1963 to serve as a sanctuary for migratory waterfowl, was combined with these new refuge lands and became the Pungo Unit of Pocosin Lakes NWR.  Today the Refuge encompasses more than 113,000 acres.  



Prior to its establishment, many acres of refuge wetlands were drained through a network of canals and ditches to expand agricultural areas; an alteration that has made the refuge more vulnerable to wildfires.



Pocosin Lakes NWR was established to provide habitat for migratory waterfowl and other birds, to protect and enhance a unique type of wetlands called pocosin, to protect and enhance habitat for those species which are classified as endangered, threatened, or of special concern, and to provide opportunities for wildlife-oriented interpretation, outdoor recreation and environmental education.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>The Refuge is located 6 miles south of Columbia, NC off Hwy 94 on the east and 18 miles south of Plymouth, NC off Hwy 45 on the west.  There are several access points to the refuge.  The Pungo Unit can be accessed by taking Hwy 45 South to Pantego, NC.  Other parts of the Refuge can be accessed by taking Hwy 64 to Roper and turning onto Newland Road and then taking 

Shore Drive.  The Walter B. Jones, Sr. Center for the Sounds, refuge visitor center and headquarters complex, is located on Hwy 64 in Columbia, NC next to the Tyrrell County Visitor's Center.</RecAreaDirections><RecAreaFeeDescription/><RecAreaMapURL/><RecAreaReservationURL/><RecAreaPhone>252-796-3004</RecAreaPhone><RecAreaEmail>pocosinlakes@fws.gov</RecAreaEmail><RecAreaLatitude>35.718660900000</RecAreaLatitude><RecAreaLongitude>-76.385683500000</RecAreaLongitude><Enabled>1</Enabled></RecArea><RecArea xmlns:arc="http://www.recreation.gov/architecture/"><RecAreaID>1582</RecAreaID><OrgRecAreaID/><RecAreaName>Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge</RecAreaName><RecAreaDescription>Roanoke River NWR was established in 1989 to protect and enhance wooded wetlands consisting of bottomland hardwoods and swamps with high waterfowl value along the Roanoke River.  The extensive bottomland hardwood habitat of the Roanoke River NWR is part of what the Nature Conservancy calls "one of the last great places."



Refuge lands consist of bottomland hardwood forest interspersed with cypress-tupelo sloughs that includes forested wetlands in the lower 130 miles of the Roanoke River from the fall line at Weldon, NC downstream to the Albemarle Sound near Plymouth, NC. The refuge includes part of an extensive wetland ecosystem that contains excellent examples of several southeastern plant communities and habitat types. These include levee forest, cypress-gum swamp, bottomland hardwoods, oxbows, beaver ponds and blackwater streams. These communities add to the rich mosaic of habitat types in the river's floodplain.



The refuge includes valuable wetlands for fish and wildlife; especially waterfowl, neotropical migrants, and anadromous fish.  The refuge hosts 214 species of birds, including 88 breeding resident species and the largest inland heron rookery in the state; white-tailed deer; one of the largest natural wild turkey populations in North Carolina; and a remnant population of black bear along with numerous small game and a diversity of fish species including anadromous fish.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>The refuge office/visitor contact station is located at 114 W.

The dam was built primarily to generate hydropower, but the reservoir also provides a beautiful site for fishing, canoeing, hiking, and primitive camping.&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;&#xd;
Adjacent to the Nantahala National Forest, the reservoir has very little private shoreline development, and there are no commercial recreation facilities on it.&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;&#xd;
Because of its isolated nature, relatively few fishermen use the reservoir, although there is a significant amount of rafting and fishing downstream. Sportfish include smallmouth bass, spotted bass, largemouth bass, redbreast sunfish, and white bass.&#xd;

All of the Wilderness is in the state of North Carolina. In 1976 the Swanquarter Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System.&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 1932, Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge, a satellite of Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge, encompasses 16,411 acres of islands and coastal marshland on the north side of Pamlico Sound. Another 27,082 acres of nearby open water protects migratory birds under Presidential Proclamation. &#xd;
&lt;p&gt;Access to most of Swanquarter Refuge requires a boat. One road, outside the Wilderness, leads to the refuge's 1,000-foot-long Bell Island fishing pier in the northerwest portion of the Refuge, off U.S. 264. More than one-half of the refuge has been designated Wilderness: Judith Island, Swanquarter Island, Great Island, Marsh Island, and portions of the mainland along Juniper Bay. Judith, Swanquarter, and Great Islands are entirely estuarine, dominated by black needlerush, intermittently under water usually due to wind tides. Marsh Island is almost entirely estuarine, with a small upland forest section on the extreme northern boundary. Along the mainland of Juniper Bay, the Wilderness is approximately half estuarine and half upland forest. &#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;p&gt;In uplands forested in loblolly pine you may catch a glimpse of white-tailed deer, opossums, raccoons, and squirrels. Yellow-bellied turtles and water snakes inhabit the needlerush and saw grass that blankets most of the refuge, and a few of the northernmost American alligators live here in brackish water. Most visitors come to fish from May through November for croaker, spot, speckled trout, flounder, puppydrum(young redfish), and bluefish. Crabbing is a popular sport in the warmer months. Portions of the refuge are open seasonally for waterfowl hunting.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>&lt;br&gt;The Swanquarter Wilderness is along the northern coast of Pamlico Sound. The refuge lies about 60 miles east of Washington, NC, south of the village of Swan Quarter.

As you wind your way on old settlement roads past mountain peaks and cascading waterfalls, imagine how this landscape looked decades ago when modern forestry began.



Begin your driving journey at the southern entrance to the Pisgah National Forest, once marked by an arch. Today twin columns greet you as you enter one of the earliest  National Forests in the eastern United States. The National Forest began in 1914 when the US Forest Service purchased an 80,000-acre plot of land from the George W. Vanderbilt Estate.



Though much of the forest looks untouched by man, today's trees have grown from lands logged and farmed during the late 1800s and early 1900s. In those days, a community emerged along the river with wagon roads, homes, mills, farms, and a school. When Louis Carr purchased the rights to “all timber, wood and bark standing and down” from Vanderbilt, he built rail lines along creeks to bring out the timber. These old cuts now form the path for some stretches of the byway.



Fill your camera with priceless photos of Looking Glass Falls. Located on the east side of the road about five miles from the southern start of the byway is an overlook from which you can get a fantastic view of this 60-foot high waterfall, a popular stop for generations.



Become a true nature enthusiast at the Cradle of Forestry, located 11 miles from the southern entrance of the byway. It was here that the first school of forestry in America--the Biltmore Forest School--was founded by Dr. Carl Schenck, chief forester for George Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate. From 1898 to 1913, the Biltmore Forest School taught a new science of caring for forests. Today, enjoy a hands-on exhibit or hike an interpretive trail to experience the wonders of the forest first hand.



Travel the Forest Heritage National Scenic Byway for fun, for beauty, and for a deeper understanding of the history of the forest, the people who once lived there, and those who are working today to make it as enjoyable and full of life as it was in the past.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections>&lt;strong&gt;Getting to the Byway:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asheville, NC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;* From downtown Asheville take US 25 (McDowell St) south.

Tour its beautiful beaches, thriving wildlife preserves, historic towns, and well-known lighthouses. Travelers make plans to come back even as they leave.



Centered around a rich village culture, the Outer Banks Scenic Byway is a must for any traveler looking to escape to a time of front porch talks and simple maritime living.  Explore the Down East community, an up-close look at what life was like before our hectic schedules and tourist-driven cities. The byway’s Down East showcases Outer Banks maritime culture with little impact from current-day tourism. A heritage center built by Down East communities reinforces an experience of place with stories, objects, and exhibits. The pronounced flare to the bow of a Harkers Island fishing vessel is a centuries-old boatbuilding tradition unique to regional waters. North Carolina Folk Heritage Awards in recent years have recognized a boat builder, a decoy carver, and a model boat maker -- all from Down East.  



Enjoy grand scenic views of barrier islands bracketed by the Atlantic Ocean and an estuarine system of shallow, fertile sounds on North Carolina’s Outer Banks Scenic Byway. On half of the byway’s 137.8 land miles, visitors view the corridor’s wild side of dunes, marsh, and water in the Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout National Seashores and two national wildlife refuges, Pea Island and Cedar Island. These national seashores and refuges mark the natural element along the byway as special places with beaches, tidal flats, maritime forests, and abundant marine, avian, and terrestrial wildlife.



On the byway’s Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, a “beach vacation” landscape with outstanding recreation marks eight villages surrounded by national seashore. Historic settlement patterns are visible in ancient live oaks, harbors, old houses, family cemeteries, simple churches, family stores, fish houses, and 19th-century life-saving stations. On Ocracoke and in Down East you’ll hear at least two variations of a “brogue” or dialect, with echoes of 17th- and early 18th-century English speech patterns.



Outer Banks living demands vital knowledge of wildlife, waters, and weather. That knowledge is expressed in rich traditions, building and settlement patterns, occupations, tales, songs, crafts, gardens, remedies, recipes, community events, and place names.  Fishing for a living and hunting are keys to this culture that clings to the coastal edge. Working watermen ply the region’s waters from backyard docks, marinas, and public harbors. Pound net stakes are everywhere in the sounds. Waterfowl hunters scan the sky from blinds in marshes and on far-from-land shallow waters and reefs of the sounds. 



That village culture is intimately linked to striking natural features and nationally significant historic places along the byway corridor.  A collection of the nation’s earliest civil works includes four historic lighthouses and eight early U.S. Life-Saving Service or U.S. Coast Guard stations. Villages developed around lighthouses and life-saving stations where byway heroes are honored. Roadless Cape Lookout National Seashore preserves two uninhabited historic villages to tell the stories of long-ago villages. One is near the diamond-painted Cape Lookout Lighthouse (1859). The other, Portsmouth, preserves life-saving service memories and Revolutionary War shipping stories.  Explore these remnants of the past on your trip down the North Carolina coast.



The Outer Banks Scenic Byway’s unique maritime culture references historic events with stories about piracy, war, shipwrecks, and hurricanes.  Explore North Carolina today -- the coast is calling.</RecAreaDescription><RecAreaDirections/><RecAreaFeeDescription/><RecAreaMapURL>http://library.byways.org/a/static_maps/000/000/713/NC_OuterBanks.png</RecAreaMapURL><RecAreaReservationURL/><RecAreaPhone>1-877-629-4386</RecAreaPhone><RecAreaEmail>info@outerbanksscenicbyway.org</RecAreaEmail><Enabled>1</Enabled></RecArea></RecElements>
